# Single-Cycle-4-bit-Computer-
## A single-cycle processor is a type of CPU design where each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle. This architecture simplifies control and instruction fetching, ensuring uniform execution time for all instructions .
This project can implement all of these instructions :- Instruction "Mnemonic" :
No operation "NOP" , Move "MOV" , Increment "INC" , add "ADD" , Subtract "SUB" ,Decrement "DEC" , AND "AND" ,OR ,"OR" , NOT ,"NOT" , Exclusive OR "XOR" , Shift Left "SHL" , Load Immediate "LDI' , Add Immediate "ADI" ,
Subtract Immediate "SUBI" , Load from data memory "LD " , Store into data memory "ST" .
